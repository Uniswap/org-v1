title: Uniswap V2

<Info>
Uniswap V2 is currently in a testnet release, and is slated to be deployed to mainnet in 2020 Q2, pending a successful formal verification. Looking for <Link to='/docs/v1/'>V1 documentation</Link>?
</Info>

You've arrived! The pages that follow contain comprehensive documentation of the Uniswap V2 ecosystem. Briefly, Uniswap is a protocol for exchanging [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) tokens on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/). It eliminates trusted intermediaries and unnecessary forms of rent extraction, allowing for **fast**, **efficient** trading. Where it makes tradeoffs **decentralization**, **censorship resistance**, and **security** are prioritized. Uniswap is **open-source software** licensed under [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).

You might be wondering about Uniswap V1. The first version of the protocol, [launched in November 2018](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1058376395108376577) at Devcon 4, is still around. In fact, because of its permissionless nature, it will exist for as long as Ethereum does! However, V2 includes a number of tangible improvements over V1, which this documentation will explore in depth.

# How it all Works

Uniswap is made up of a series of smart contracts, each the venue for a unique ERC-20â‡„ERC-20 pair. Pair smart contracts hold **reserves** (balances) of their constituent tokens, and define rules around how these reserves can be changed. Anyone can become a **liquidity provider** for a pair by depositing an equivalent value of each token in exchange for **pool tokens**. These tokens track liquidity providers' pro-rata shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.

Pairs act as **automated liquidity providers**, standing ready to accept one token for the other as long as the "constant product" formula is preserved. This formula, most simply expressed as `x * y = k`, states that trades must not change the _product_ (`k`) of a pair's reserve balances (`x` and `y`). Because `k` remains unchanged from the reference frame of a trade, it is often referred to as the **invariant**. This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones.

In practice, Uniswap applies a 0.30% fee to trades, which is added to reserves. As a result, each trade actually increases `k`. This functions as a payout to liquidity providers, which is realized when they burn their pool tokens to withdraw their portion of total reserves. In the future, this fee may be reduced to 0.25%, with the remaining 0.05% withheld as a protocol-wide charge.

Because the relative price of the two pair assets can only be changed through trading, divergences between the Uniswap price and external prices create **arbitrage opportunities**. This mechanism ensures that Uniswap prices always trend toward the market-clearing price.
