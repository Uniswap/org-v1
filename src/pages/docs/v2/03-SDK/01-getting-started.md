# Code

[uniswap-sdk](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-sdk/tree/v2)

# Overview

The Uniswap SDK is meant to simplify the process of integrating Uniswap into your project. It's easy to use, but also feature-rich, offering tiered levels of abstraction that make it suitable for use nearly anywhere, from hackathon projects to production applications.

The SDK is written in TypeScript, has a robust test suite, supports rounding to both significant digits and fixed decimals, uses [JSBI](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi) (and eventually native [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)s) for math operations, and supports all environments in which the <Link to='/docs/v2/smart-contracts/factory#address'>factory</Link> is deployed.

# Install

`yarn add @uniswap/sdk@next`

More documentation coming soon...
