title: Iframe Integration

<Info>
Uniswap V1, while still fully functional, is no longer under active development. Looking for <Link to='/docs/v2/'>V2 documentation</Link>?
</Info>

The Uniswap frontend can be used within other sites as an iframe. An iframe shows an exact version of the app.uniswap.org site and can have custom prefilled settings.

# Why You May Want This

Integrating the Uniswap frontend directly into your web application can be useful for a variety of reasons.

v1.app.uniswap.org is an interface allows users to buy, sell, send, or provide liquidity for ERC20 tokens using the Uniswap protocol. An iframe integration may be useful if your application provides services around these ERC20 tokens. \(For example, users can buy DAI through a Uniswap frontend iframe on your site, then allow users to lend that DAI on your site\).

It can also be useful if your application requires users to acquire some token in order to use some service \(For example, allow users to buy "GRT" token so they can engage in activity on The Graph network\).

# iframe vs. custom UI

One benefit of an iframe integration is that your site will automatically keep up with any improvements/additions to the v1.app.uniswap.org frontend. After the initital integration is setup no further work is needed to pull in updates as the Uniswap frontend is updated over time.

# Live Example

An example of an iframe integration can be found on the FOAM site [https://map.foam.space/](https://map.foam.space/#/at/?lng=-74.0045300&lat=40.6771800&zoom=5.00)

To see the iframe click the dropdown in the top right and click "get foam".

# Add To Your Site

To include a Uniswap frontend iframe within your site just add an iframe element within your website code and link to the Uniswap frontend.

Linking to a ETH &lt;-&gt; DAI trading page would look something like this. To link to a token of your choice replace the address after "outputCurrency" with the token address of the token you want to link to.

```text
<iframe
  src="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?use=v1?outputCurrency=0x89d24a6b4ccb1b6faa2625fe562bdd9a23260359"
  height="660px"
  width="100%"
  style="
    border: 0;
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: block;
    border-radius: 10px;
    max-width: 600px;
    min-width: 300px;
  "
  id="myId"
/>
```

You can customize the selected page, selected custom tokens and more using URL query parameters. See <Link to='/docs/v1/frontend-integration/custom-linking'>Custom Linking</Link>.
