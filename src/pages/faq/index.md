# What is Uniswap?

The Uniswap protocol is immutable software for creating liquidity and trading ERC-20 tokens on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/). It eliminates trusted intermediaries and unnecessary forms of rent extraction, allowing for fast, efficient trading. Where it makes tradeoffs - decentralization, censorship resistance and security are prioritized. The Uniswap protocol is managed by Uniswap Governance, which includes anyone who holds the UNI governance token. If you want to dive into details about the Uniswap protocol check out the [docs](/docs/v2/).

The [Uniswap interface](http://app.uniswap.org/) is one of many web-based user interfaces that can be used to access the liquidity and trading functions of the Uniswap protocol. It is maintained by the Uniswap Labs team.

# How do I use Uniswap?

First you'll need an [Ethereum Wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) and some [ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/). Once completed, head over to the [Uniswap interface](http://app.uniswap.org/) (or any other interface) to start using the protocol to provide liquidity or trade tokens. Remember that each transaction on Ethereum costs ETH (this is called the ["gas fee"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJvzNICwcwc&feature=emb_title) and it's paid to miners to keep the network running).

# How does the Uniswap protocol work?

The Uniswap protocol is an [automated liquidity protocol](https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/#dex). In practical terms this means there are template smart contracts that define a standard way to make liquidity pools and corresponding markets that are compatible with each other. There is no orderbook, no centralized party and no central facilitator of trade. Each pool is defined by a smart contract that includes a few functions to enable swapping tokens, adding liquidity and more. At its core each pool uses the function `x*y=k` to maintain a curve along which trades can happen. The pools keep track of reserves(liquidity) and updates those reserves every single time someone trades. Because the reserves are automatically rebalanced, a Uniswap pool can always be used to buy or sell a token without requiring a counterparty on the other side of a trade.

For a more in-depth description. Check out the [How Uniswap works](/docs/v2/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works/) from the Uniswap protocol documentation.

# How are prices determined?

Prices are determined by the amount of each token in a pool. The smart contract maintains a constant using the following function: `x*y=k`. In this case `x = token0`, `y = token1`, `k = constant`. During each trade a certain amount of one token is removed from the pool for an amount of the other token. To maintain `k`, the balances held by the smart contract are adjusted during the execution of the trade, therefore changing the price.

# I saw a token was trading at X value, but when I traded on the Uniswap protocol I got a much lower value!

Websites that show token prices, like eitherscan.io or coinmarketcap.com, typically aggregate price data from multiple sources. Some of these sources can be inaccurate, especially regarding new or low volume tokens. If a website or app says a token is worth more than what is shown on the Uniswap protocol, it is due to the websiteâ€™s or app's inaccurate data sources. If you are using the Uniswap interface, always check the exchange rate on the Uniswap interface before trading.

# Why is my swap failing or stuck?

You might be trying to swap a fee on transfer or deflationary token. If so, you have to increase your allowed slippage to account for the fee taken during the swap. Click on the gear for settings and adjust slippage tolerance accordingly.

Otherwise, if your transaction is taking forever or stuck pending, the gas included might be too low and the transaction will not be processed. You probably need to speed up or cancel the transaction in you wallet.

# Why is my approve stuck?

If you speed up an approve, the Uniswap interface can't detect the new transaction. Open your wallet in the interface and click "clear all" then try refreshing the page.

# How do I find X token?

If you can't find a token in the default list, find the token address using etherscan and paste that address into the search field.

# How do I add a logo for a token?

The Uniswap interface pulls from the trustwallet asset repository on github. [https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets) Add your token icon to that repo and it will appear on the frontend and on info.

# How can I add a token to the Uniswap protocol?

The Uniswap protocol is compatible with any ERC-20 token in the Ethereum ecosystem. If you want your project to be searchable in the Uniswap interface, you should seek to be added to a reputable token list or share a link to your token using query parameters. Once loaded via link, the token will be added to Uniswap interface.

Another option is to open a request using github [issues](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-frontend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=token+request&template=token-request.md&title=).

The Uniswap Labs team makes no guarantees nor provides any timeline for such requests. Nor will the team ever charge or request funds. We've added many UX features to make it easier to share a new token with communities - features such as local storage support and custom linking. Please make use of them.

# Why does my transaction cost X?

Ethereum requires gas to execute each transaction. You can also check ETH gas station for the current prices required to complete transactions. Creating a Uniswap protocol pool is a slightly costlier transaction because you are executing a more complex smart contract. Read more about how gas works in Ethereum.

# How can I see my liquidity provider fees?

There are many community built tools like [https://www.uniswaproi.com/](https://www.uniswaproi.com/), [https://www.zapper.fi/dashboard](https://www.zapper.fi/dashboard) and [https://zerion.io/](https://zerion.io/). Uniswap Labs provides no guarantees the information on these sites is correct.

# I accidentally transferred tokens directly to a pair contract, is there any way I can get them back?

Uniswap protocol token pair contracts are ownerless. Uniswap Labs has no special control over the pair contracts' functionality; because of this, any tokens accidentally transferred to the token contract itself are lost forever.

# I updated my token via a proxy contract, but the Uniswap protocol information page is showing the old symbol / name!

[Info.uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/) reads the details of new tokens when they're added to the Uniswap protocol subgraph. There may be some circumstances where an old symbol or name isn't updated if the token was updated with a proxy contract. A guide to fix this yourself is forthcoming. In the meantime, reach out with the details on our developer discord.

# My swap failed with code "EXPIRED", what happened?

If a swap takes more than 20 minutes to execute, the router is programmed to fail the transaction. This is to protect the user from extreme swings in prices that can occur while the transaction is pending. If this happens, your tokens will still be in your wallet, but the gas fees paid are not recoverable. To keep this from happening, use a high enough gas price to have your transaction mined in under 20 minutes. This usually falls under "Standard" or "Fast" in most gas price calculators.
